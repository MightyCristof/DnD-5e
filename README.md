Form fillable sheets for D&D 5e that I've modified.  
I don't take credit for any of these, I simply found them online somewhere and decided to make some changes.  

</br>

__Character Sheet__
  
* corrected a skill field error (Medicine and Investigate fields were linked)
* added additional weapon slots to "Attacks & Spellcasting"
* split "Other Proficiencies & Languages" into four sections; languages, tools, weapons, armor
* split "Equipment & Character Notes" into two sections
* split "Additional Features & Traits" into two sections
* split "Treasure" into two sections and added coin fields
* doubled the number of spell fields for each level

__Major NPC__ 

* decreased field sizes for aesthetics
* decreased "Roleplay Information" section and added img field for NPC portrait

__Minor NPC__

* previous PDF was not form fillable, added form fields
* normalized field font to match other sheets (Helvetica)

__PC Tracker__

* decreased field sizes for aesthetics
* rekeyed "clear PDF" buttons (button right)
* normalized field font to match other sheets (Helvetica)

__Combat Encounter__

* decreased "Notes" section and added "clear PDF" buttons (bottom left)
* decreased field sizes for aesthetics
* normalized field font to match other sheets (Helvetica)

Speed Factor Initiative Cards. The scan of the table from the DMG you find online is blurry.

I made my own using the D&D 5e LaTeX template by Evan Bergeron.
